# SyNergy Published Research Projects: Index of GitHub Repositories

Welcome to the Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy) GitHub page!

Here you can explore associated GitHub repositories for published projects from SyNergy, and links to their respective PubMed articles.

**About SyNergy:**

Using systems neurology as a new interdisciplinary approach, SyNergy researchers investigate the shared disease mechanisms of neurovascular, neurodegenerative, and neuroimmunological diseases, and on this basis develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
SyNergy has been funded as an Excellence Cluster by the German Research Foundation (DFG) since 2012.
